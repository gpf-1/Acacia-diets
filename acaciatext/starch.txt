starchy foods are often referred to as 'carbs', this is a little misleading as carbohydrates include both starch and sugars, as well as fibre.
Starchy foods provide important nutrients to the diet including B vitamins, iron, calcium and folate. Starchy foods can also provide fibre which is needed for good digestive health and is associated with a lower risk of heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes and bowel cancer.
